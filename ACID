ACID


    Atomicity:transactions must complete succssfully  or fail complrtely
    Consistancy:once an application performs an operation the results of that operation are visible to it in every subsequent operation
    Isolation:an incomplete operation by one user does not cause unexpected side effects for other users
    Durability:once an operation is complete it will be preserved even in the face of machine or system failure
    
    
Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD) - dimensions that change slowly over time, rather than changing on regular schedule, time-base. 
In Data Warehouse there is a need to track changes in dimension attributes in order to report historical data. 
In other words, implementing one of the SCD types should enable users assigning proper dimension's attribute value for given date. 
Example of such dimensions could be: customer, geography, employee.

There are many approaches how to deal with SCD. The most popular are:


Type 0 - The passive method
Type 1 - Overwriting the old value
Type 2 - Creating a new additional record
Type 3 - Adding a new column
Type 4 - Using historical table
Type 6 - Combine approaches of types 1,2,3 (1+2+3=6)
