STRICT MODE:

    STRICT MODE 
        
        HIVE STRICT MODE RESTRICT SOME OPERATIONS IN HIVE.
        
    1. IT RESTRICTS QUERIES ON PARTITIONED TABLE WITHOUT WHERE CLAUSE
    
      set hive.mapred.mode=strict;
      select * from t1;
      FAILED: SemanticException [Error 10041]: No partition predicate found for Alias "t1" Table "t1"
      select * from t1 where country="india";
       1       {"mounika":"800000"}    india
       
     2. IT RESTRICTS USE OF ORDER BY CLAUSE WITHOUT LIMIT(IN ORDER BY A SINGLE REDUCER WILL BE USED WHICH REDUCES THE PERORMANCE)
     
     select * from tt1 order by iD;
     FAILED: SemanticException 1:27 In strict mode, if ORDER BY is specified, LIMIT must also be specified. Error encountered near token 'id'
     
     SELECT * FROM TT1 ORDER BY ID LIMIT 4;
     1       {"mounika":"800000"}    india
     2       {"satya":"1000000"}     us


    3. The third and final type of query prevented is a Cartesian product. 
    Users coming from the relational database world may expect that queries that perform a JOIN not with an ON clause but with a WHERE clause will have the query optimized by the query planner, effectively converting the WHERE clause into an ON clause.
    Unfortunately, Hive does not perform this optimization, so a runaway query will occur if the tables are large:
    
    NONSTRICT:
    
    select * from t1 join tt1 where t1.id=tt1.id;
    1       {"MOUNIKA":"800000"}    INDIA   1       {"mounika":"800000"}    india
    1       {"mounika":"800000"}    INDIA   1       {"mounika":"800000"}    india
    2       {"satya":"1000000"}     INDIA   2       {"satya":"1000000"}     us
    1       {"mounika":"800000"}    india   1       {"mounika":"800000"}    india
    2       {"satya":"1000000"}     us      2       {"satya":"1000000"}     us
    1       {"\"mounika\"":"\"800000\""}    INDIA   1       {"mounika":"800000"}    india
    2       {"\"satya\"":"\"1000000\""}     INDIA   2       {"satya":"1000000"}     us
    
    STRICT:
    select * from t1 join tt1 where t1.id=tt1.id;
    FAILED: SemanticException [Error 10041]: No partition predicate found for Alias "t1" Table "t1"
